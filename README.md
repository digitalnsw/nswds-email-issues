# NSW Email Design System Issue Tracker

This repository keeps track of issues in the [NSW Email Design System](https://email.designsystem.nsw.gov.au).

> **Note:** This repo is for **issues only** – it does not contain the email templates, components, or source code. Those live in separate implementation repositories.

---

## Purpose

This issue tracker is the central place to:

- Report bugs and defects
- Request new features or enhancements
- Ask questions about usage and compatibility
- Track known issues and planned improvements

Using a single tracker helps us keep discussions in one place and makes it easier to see the overall health of the NSW Email Design System.

## How to Raise an Issue

When opening a new issue, please include:

### For Bugs

- **Summary** – short, clear description of the problem  
- **Steps to Reproduce** – list each step as clearly as possible  
- **Expected Behaviour** – what you thought would happen  
- **Actual Behaviour** – what actually happened  
- **Environment**
  - Email client(s) (e.g. Outlook 365 desktop, Apple Mail, Gmail, etc.)
  - Platform (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, web)
- **Code Sample / Template**
  - Minimal HTML snippet if possible, or a link to the template
- **Screenshots**
  - Screenshots or screen recordings are extremely helpful

### For Feature Requests

- **Background / Problem** – what you’re trying to achieve  
- **Proposed Solution** – what you’d like to see added or changed  
- **Use Cases** – where and how this would be used  
- **Constraints / Considerations** – performance, accessibility, policy, etc. if relevant

### For Questions

- **Context** – what you’re working on (high level)  
- **What You’ve Tried** – links, docs, or approaches you’ve already looked at  
- **The Specific Question** – as clear and concrete as possible

## Labels & Triage

We use labels to help triage and prioritise issues. Common labels include:

- `bug` – something is broken
- `enhancement` – improvement to an existing feature
- `feature-request` – new capability or component
- `documentation` – docs-related issue
- `question` – general question or clarification
- `accessibility` – accessibility-related issue
- `email-client:<name>` – issues specific to an email client

New issues are periodically reviewed and labelled by maintainers.

---

## Security & Sensitive Issues

Please **do not** report security-sensitive issues (e.g. vulnerabilities, data exposure) in public issues.

Instead, contact the maintainers through the appropriate internal security or support channels for your organisation. If you’re unsure which channel to use, speak with your team’s technical lead or product owner.

---

## Contributing

At this stage, contributions are primarily via **issues** (reporting bugs, suggesting enhancements, and asking questions).

If or when code contributions (PRs) are accepted for related implementation repositories, contribution guidelines will be documented in those repos.
